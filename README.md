## Backup Script (wp-backup.sh)

I created a custom Bash script that backs up both the WordPress site files and the MySQL database. It compresses the backups and logs the process. This script is scheduled via `cron` for daily automatic backups.

### Features:
- Compresses WordPress site folder
- Dumps and compresses MySQL database
- Logs all output with timestamps
- Easy to modify and reuse
