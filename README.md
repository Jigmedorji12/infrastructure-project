## Disk_check.sh

**Purpose:**  
This script monitors the root disk usage of the EC2 server. If usage exceeds 80%, it logs a warning to `/var/log/disk_check.log`.

**Features:**
- Logs current date and disk usage
- Alerts if usage exceeds 80%
- logs are saved to ~/disk_check.log for user-friendly access
- Can be automated using cron to run hourly or daily
