Script
Purpose: Checks server disk usage and logs warning if usage exceeds 80%
On the command line go:
Cd ~
nano disk_check.sh
enter: 
#!/bin/bash
# Log the current date
date >> /var/log/disk_check.log
# Check disk usage
USAGE=$(df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
# Log status
if [ "$USAGE" -gt 80 ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Disk usage is at ${USAGE}%!" >> /var/log/disk_check.log
else
  echo "Disk usage is normal: ${USAGE}%" >> /var/log/disk_check.log
fi
 
This Monitors your server’s root disk space. Logs a warning message if usage exceeds 80%.
Run this command line: 
crontab -e
Add this line to check every hour:
0 * * * * /bin/bash /path/to/disk-check.sh
This Runs every hour and logs disk space info. Helps catch low storage issues before they cause problems.
